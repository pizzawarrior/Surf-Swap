## Welcome to Surf Swap

### Problem Statement:
1. Surfboards are expensive, and rental options are bleak.
2. There aren't many options to try a surfboard before commiting to buying one, which is upwards of $750 each time!

### Our Solution
* Try before you buy
* We connect surfers, and help them gain access to one another's collections of surfboards
* Users can create an account, add their own surfboards, and make reservations to borrow other people's boards
* This eliminates the risk of buying a board that simply does not click, which unsurprisingly happens a lot
* Have a dream board you're dying to try? Find it on Surf Swap
